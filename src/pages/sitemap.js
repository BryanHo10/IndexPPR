// We probably want the index controller.  For now I'm okay with us making each page -- that'd work and be easy and perforamnce-wise it seems it'll compile the same.
// However from a design / code-style perspective the controller is more modular and preferable.


// The sitemap can also be JSON -- it'd be better to dynamically generate this.
// For now I just noob hardcoded it for visualization.

/*
Refactor and use this when we have a base site working...
